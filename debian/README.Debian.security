Important note
==============

The Spring Framework alias libspring-java in Debian is not intended to be used
to develop web applications for production purposes. It is mainly required to
build other packages. There will be no security support for the life time of a
stable release. Only use it to build other Debian packages or in a trusted
environment like your local network with trusted devices.
